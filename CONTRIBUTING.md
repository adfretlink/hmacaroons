First and most important: Submit issues !

If you want to contribute, please fork the repo, and send us a pull request with
your changes.

Tests and cabal flags
---------------------
For this project we use the standard hunit/quickcheck tests.
If you want to submit a new feature, please try to integrate at least
*some* tests.

Code style
----------
We do not impose any specific style of code, but you can improve your code
by running it through `hlint`.

Crypto analysis
---------------
This library has **not** been audited by security experts !
It relies on an existing implementation and crypto libraries.

Any analysis is welcome, and I will gladly merge it.
